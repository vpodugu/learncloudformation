# Using StackSets for Multi-Region Deployment

## Overview
In this bonus task, we'll explore how to use AWS CloudFormation StackSets to deploy resources across multiple regions. This approach is particularly useful when you need to ensure your infrastructure is available across different geographic locations for better scalability and disaster recovery.

## Why StackSets Matter
- **Consistency**: Deploy the same infrastructure across multiple regions
- **Simplified Management**: Control all deployments from a single template
- **Easy Scaling**: Automatically provision resources in new regions
- **Better Resilience**: Protect against regional failures with multi-region deployments

## Understanding StackSets
StackSets work in three main steps:
1. First, you create a StackSet with your CloudFormation template and target regions
2. Then, StackSets automatically creates stacks in each specified region
3. Finally, you can manage and update all stacks from a central location

## Implementation Guide

### Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have:
- Administrator-level permissions for StackSets
- AWS CLI or Console access
- IAM roles with the following permissions:
  - `AWSCloudFormationStackSetAdministrationRole`
  - `AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole`

### Step 1: Set Up IAM Roles
You'll need to create an execution role in each target account. This role allows StackSets to create and manage stacks on your behalf.

### Step 2: Create Your StackSet Template
We'll modify the template in `exercises/07-bonus-stacksets/stackset-template.yaml` to define our resources.

### Step 3: Deploy the StackSet
Run this command to create your StackSet:
```sh
aws cloudformation create-stack-set --stack-set-name MultiRegionDeployment \
  --template-body file://stackset-template.yaml \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
```

### Step 4: Deploy Across Regions
Use this command to create stack instances in your target regions:
```sh
aws cloudformation create-stack-instances --stack-set-name MultiRegionDeployment \
  --accounts 123456789012 \
  --regions us-east-1 us-west-1 eu-central-1
```

### Step 5: Verify Your Deployment
Check the status of your deployment with:
```sh
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name MultiRegionDeployment
```
Make sure all instances are deployed successfully in your chosen regions.
